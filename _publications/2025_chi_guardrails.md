abstract: "
<p>
The growing popularity of interactive time series exploration platforms has made data visualization more accessible to the public. However, the ease of creating polished charts with preloaded data also enables selective information presentation, often resulting in biased or misleading visualizations. Research shows that these tools have been used to spread misinformation, particularly in areas such as public health and economic policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post hoc fact-checking may be ineffective because it typically addresses only a portion of misleading posts and comes too late to curb the spread. In this work, we explore using visualization design to counteract cherry-picking, a common tactic in deceptive visualizations. We propose a design space of guardrailsâ€”interventions to expose cherry-picking in time-series explorers. Through three crowd-sourced experiments, we demonstrate that guardrails, particularly those superimposing data, can encourage skepticism, though with some limitations. We provide recommendations for developing more effective visualization guardrails.
