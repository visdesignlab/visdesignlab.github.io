In this talk I introduce the reVISit framework for designing and running empirical studies online. Traditional survey tools limit the flexibility and reproducibility of online experiments. To remedy this, we introduce a domain-specific language, the reVISit Spec, that researchers can use to design complex online user studies. reVISit Spec, combined with the relevant stimuli, is compiled into a ready-to-deploy website that handles all aspects of a user study, including sophisticated provenance-based data tracking, randomization, etc. reVISit is a community focused project and ready to use! Visit https://revisit.dev/ to get started. 

I will then pivot to talk about data-driven misinformation in the form of charts shared on social networks. I will demonstrate that “lying with charts” doesn’t work the way we (used to) think about it, and introduce a few strategies to “protect” charts and charting tools from being abused by malicious users. I will connect back to
