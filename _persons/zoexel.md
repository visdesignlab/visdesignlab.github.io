I'm a junior at the University of Utah beginning my BS Thesis through the School of Computing working with Alexander Lex and Zach Cutler. My current research is focused on bird migrations at the Great Salt Lake, and we are working towards modelling how population sizes are changing as a result of climatic changes in order to better predict how bird migrations might be affected. I am extremely passionate about using data science to understand various environmental phenomena, and I hope to further explore this as I complete my thesis through SCI.
