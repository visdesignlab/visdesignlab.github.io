I am a web developer at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute (SCI) at the University of Utah, where I work on the ReVISIT project. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, a Data Science Certificate, and a minor in Psychology from the University of Utah. I love creating software that makes peopleâ€™s lives easier and more efficient.

During my undergraduate capstone project, I built an inventory management system for the University of Utah pantry, helping them streamline operations and improve overall efficiency.
